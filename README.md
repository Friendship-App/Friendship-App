Generators
----------

You can use generators to automate tasks such as creating new components,
containers, views, etc...

Pepperoni app kit uses `plop` as its generator framework. All generators are
stored in `generators/` and any `.js` file is automatically loaded from this
directory. Feel free to create your own and modify existing generators
according to which common tasks you perform in your project!

###Generator setup

1. `yarn global add plop` or `npm install -g plop`
2. Run `plop` in the repository root
3. Follow the on-screen instructions!
